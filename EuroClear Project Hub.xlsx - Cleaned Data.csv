Zopa takes on such responsibilities as distributing money between parties, completing the legal paperwork, performing borrower identity/credit checks, and employing a collections agency that chases missed payments for the lender. Zopa also mitigates risk for lenders by enforcing monthly direct debit repayment, making borrowers sign a legal contract, and allowing lenders to lend small chunks of money to individual borrowers (i.e. someone lending Ã‚Â£1000 would have their money spread across say, 100 borrowers).

Businesses can use their business data to submit an application online and receive an answer in minutes instead of waiting weeks and filling out numerous forms like traditional lending methods. Businesses can access ongoing lines of credit up to $250,000. Kabbage leverages business data generated such as revenue, accounting data, business transactions, shipping data, social media and other sources to understand a businessâ€™s overall health and calculate credit lines throughout the customer lifecycle. The company began serving online merchants in 2011 and extended its automated lending platform to all small businesses â€“ online and brick-and-mortar â€“ in February 2014. In November 2013, Kabbage expanded its business to mobile with an iOS and Android app that enables users to apply or access their funds from their smartphones. Kabbage used to provide a consumer lending product, Karrot, but it is no longer available. Kabbage expanded the application of its platform in March 2015 by licensing the data and technology platform to power lending for other organizations. The company was named one of Forbes magazineâ€™s Most Promising Companies list for the second year in a row. Kabbage further extended its lending reach in May 2015 with the announcement of the new Kabbage Card, which gives businesses the ability to pay for items at the point of sale with a purchasing card tied to their Kabbage account. Kabbage also collaborated with MasterCard in May 2015 to make Kabbageâ€™s data and technology platform available through MasterCardâ€™s network of acquirers. In August 2015, Kabbage was named the 36th fastest-growing private company in America on the Inc. 500 list.

In June 2016, Kabbage was named to CNBC's annual Disruptor 50 list of the most forward-thinking and ambitious companies that are revolutionizing industries and markets worldwide. Two months later, Kabbage was named to the Inc. 500 list of the country's fastest-growing private companies for the second year in a row In August 2016, Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) upgraded and affirmed ratings on Class A2-2 Certificates issued by Kabbage Funding 2014-1 Resecurization Trust. The certificates were upgraded from BBB+(sf) to A-(sf) based on structural improvements to the transactionâ€™s concentration requirements and the existence of more historical data relating to Kabbageâ€™s collateral. KBRA also affirmed the ratings on the Class B2A Certificates of BB-(sf), Class B2B Certificates of BB-(sf) and Class B2C Certificates of B+(sf), which were initially rated in November 2015.
